IPA Zounds
==========

IPA Zounds models language sound change by applying a given set of
sound change rules to a given lexicon. It has a built-in model of the
IPA, allowing users to write input words in IPA characters, and rules
using those characters and/or the distinctive features of the
model. So, for example, a rule to lengthen any vowel before a final
voiced postalveolar fricative would be written as:
[+syllabic]/[+long]/_Ê’#.
