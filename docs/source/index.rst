Welcome to IPA Zounds's documentation!
======================================

IPA Zounds is a sound change applier: a program that models linguistic
sound change by applying sound change rules to a list of words. It
uses a binary features model of the
:abbr:`IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)`,
allowing users to write words and rules using
:abbr:`IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)`
characters and the distinctive features of the model.

So, for example, a rule to lengthen any vowel before a final voiced
postalveolar fricative would be written as::

   [+syllabic]/[+long]/_Ê’#
